      <section class="about-section">
        <h3>The Birth of Speed</h3>
        <p>
          BertUI was born from frustration with the Node.js ecosystem's speed—or lack thereof. 
          The original vision was ambitious: to replace the entire Next.js **full-stack** stack with Bun. 
          However, implementing complex full-stack features proved too much. Instead of compromising the foundation, 
          I pivoted to create the **ultimate static-first React framework**—purely for speed and superior UI.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vite was fast, but it wasn't **fast enough**. When I discovered Bun's native performance—
          easily surpassing ESBuild (Vite's engine)—the concept crystalized on **26/11/2025**.
        </p>
      </section>

      
      <section class="about-section about-frustration">
        <h3>The "Cool Vite" Problem</h3>
        <p>
          We achieved something incredible: **38ms compilation**, **265ms builds**, 
          and a development experience that felt like magic. But the community's response was crushing:
        </p>
        <blockquote class="about-quote">
          "It's just Cool Vite."
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Those three words almost ended BertUI. They exposed our Achilles' heel: despite the blazing speed, 
          we were still a **client-side rendering (CSR) framework**. That meant:
        </p>
        <ul class="about-problems">
          <li>❌ Poor SEO - search engines saw blank pages</li>
          <li>❌ Slow First Contentful Paint - users waited for JavaScript</li>
          <li>❌ Sacrificing web fundamentals for speed</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The comments were unbearable. Every comparison to Vite felt like a dismissal of the real innovation 
          we'd achieved. I seriously considered giving up on BertUI entirely.
        </p>
      </section>

      
      <section class="about-section about-breakthrough">
        <h3>The Moment Everything Changed</h3>
        <p>
          Instead of quitting, I took time to think. SSR (Server-Side Rendering) was too complex—it required 
          server infrastructure, hydration overhead, and configuration hell. But I needed **something** 
          to make BertUI more than just "fast Vite."
        </p>
        <p>
          The core issue with Next.js was its complexity and forced decisions. What if BertUI could offer the content benefits **optionally**?
        </p>
        <p class="about-eureka">
          <strong>What if it was just one line per page?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          That's when <strong>Server Islands</strong> was born.
        </p>
      </section>

      
      <section class="about-section about-solution">
        <h3>🏝️ Server Islands: The Game Changer</h3>
        <p>
          Server Islands is BertUI's uncompromising answer to the "Cool Vite" problem. It's **Static Site Generation (SSG)** on a diet. It's <strong>optional, per-page static HTML generation</strong> with literally one line:
        </p>
        <div class="about-code-example">
          <pre><code>export const render = "server";</code></pre>
        </div>
        <p>
          Add that line to any content page, and BertUI converts it to **pure static HTML** at build time. No react-dom/server. No complex routing. Just **instant SEO and FCP**.
        </p>

        <h3>BertUI's Minimalist Core: Just 3 Dependencies</h3>
        <p>
          To maintain our commitment to speed and zero-configuration, BertUI uses only **three core dependencies**:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            **Elysia:** Powers the lightning-fast dev server and handles HMR via WebSockets
          </li>
          <li>
            **Lightning CSS:** Industry-leading Rust-powered CSS minification and optimization
          </li>
          <li>
            **ernest-logger:** Clean, colorful terminal output (<a href='https://www.npmjs.com/package/ernest-logger' target='_blank'>docs</a>)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        **We prioritize stability and speed over feature bloat.**

      <section class="about-section">
        <h3>The Road to v1.1.0: Relentless Innovation</h3>
        <p>
          The learning curve was brutal. I had no experience with React build processes, and Bun was brand new. 
          Early versions were unusable—only the dev server would launch. This led to intense, sleepless development.
        </p>
        <p>
          I relied on AI tools like **Gemini** and **Claude** to bridge the knowledge gap. 
          The path to stability required **over 35 beta versions** and countless failed attempts.
        </p>
        <p>
          On **16/12/2025**, after **39 rounds of testing**, version **v1.0.0** 
          launched. Everything worked. BertUI was stable.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the "Cool Vite" comments haunted me. So I kept going. On **23/12/2025**, 
          **v1.1.0** launched with Server Islands. The game changed.
